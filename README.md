Project Title: PodcastAutoEditor, A way to Edit your milti camera podcast without having to do it yourself in an editing software.

Project Description: This program is made to auto edit a podcast with multiple camera angles. Right now the program can only handle 3 angles, which is
two angles facing two people and a middle angle that should show both people in frame. I plan to make the program allow for more angles in the future.
There is a step by step guide in a GUI on how to use this program once you have it up and running. I used the MoviePy module and Tkinter for the GUI. 

How to install and run the project: First have python3 installed, then install the moviepy module using "pip install moviepy." Then install Tkinter
using "pip install tk." You also might have to install numpy using "pip install numpy." Then inside the folder where you have this repo cloned,
run "python3 podcastproj.py" and if the GUI pops up then you're golden and everything installed is working properly!

How to use the project: Follow the instrutions in the GUI and your final file will be placed in the same folder you are running the file from.
